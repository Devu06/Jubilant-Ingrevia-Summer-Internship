# Jubilant Ingrevia Summer Internship
 My main task at Jubilant is to revamp the frontend of the homepage for their employee portal and make it more responsive, appealing, user-friendly and at the same time keeping the essence of the home page same as the prwvious one. For this project I used HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, JAVASCRIPT, Jquery, and other javascript libraries like micron.js, aos.js, and flat-remix-css.
